# LoRa Range Test Comparison

## Introduction
This project compares the range performance of two LoRa modules: SX1276 and RYLR998. The aim is to provide insights into their capabilities under various conditions.

## Methodology
### Hardware Used
- **SX1276 Module**: [[Link to datasheet or product page](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XbGJ3n85z9ruFIZIR3pf4iT_ciRSNruP/view?usp=drive_link)]
- **RYLR998 Module**: [[Link to datasheet or product page](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14TzN-kvCyWQNE_3eZQ7v73Q64Uy4R5tQ/view?usp=drive_link)]

### Test Setup
1. **Line of Sight**:The transmitter and the receiver should have a line of sight adn there shouldn't be any concrete buildings in between because it causes a lot of decrease in range
2. **Weather conditions**: consider Operating on a sunny day and not in a rainy atmosphere

### Procedure
1. **Transmitter Setup**: Describe how the transmitter was set up and configured.
2. **Receiver Setup**: Describe how the receiver was set up and configured.
3. **Measurements**: Explain how you measured the range and collected RSSI values.

## Results
### SX1276
- **Maximum Range**: xxx meters
- **Average RSSI**: xxx dBm
- **Notes**: Any additional observations

### RYLR998
- **Maximum Range**: xxx meters
- **Average RSSI**: xxx dBm
- **Notes**: Any additional observations

### Comparison
- **Range Difference**: Compare the maximum ranges.
- **RSSI Analysis**: Compare the average RSSI values.

## Conclusion
Summarize your findings and provide any recommendations based on your results.
